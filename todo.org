* sketch of the plan:
** start with papers:
*** Virtual Cluster Embedding, the journal version Elsevier TCS

*** possibly the Tree Caching if Jasiek allows me to
*** most likely the Knapsack paper
** make a detailed plan what to do
** write a system-oriented intro that glues the papers together
** rewrite Knapsack paper in term of jobs
** get to know the domain and collect references from the domain
* proposed title: "Communication-efficient job partitioning"
* due date: January
* TODO bibliography, add the notes of previous usages
** Tadek's MSc: the lower-bound for Knapsack
** Ola's MSc: parts of TC
** Carlo's PHd: whole VCEMB
* Offline Tree Caching is already known
