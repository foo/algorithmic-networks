Dear Editor, 

Please find enclosed our manuscript submitted to SIAM Journal on Discrete
Mathematics.

Parts of the material of this article were presented at the 30th International
Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC), Paris, France, September 2016. We
significantly revised the article for this journal version and present
improved results:

- We give a completely new analysis of the CREP algorithm (Section 4). As 
  a result of this new analysis, we were able to derive an improved theorem:
  CREP is competitive already with (2+eps)-augmentation (in the conference
  version we assumed an 4-augmentation).

- We present a new analysis for the online matching problem. While the main
  result in the theorem did not change compared to the conference version, we
  believe that the new potential function proof is much more elegant.

- We also reworked the non-technical parts of the paper.

We herewith confirm that the article is not under submission at any other
journal.

Thank you very much for your time and considering our work for publication.

On behalf of all authors, 

Marcin Bienkowski
