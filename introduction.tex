Organization of the ``paper'', how connected the chapters are.

\section{New Challenges in Data Centers and Networking}

\subsection{Software-defined Networking}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Goal: management of network devices
  \item Pre-SDN approaches characterization: decentralized. List disadvantages (lack of: security, scalability, flexibility)
  \item Programmable approach to network devices management
  \item Logical separation of forwarding and routing packages
  \item Centralized approach to network devices management. Brief overview of 
  \item Standarized, open protocols to communicate with network devices
  \item Advantages of SDN
\end{enumerate}

\todo{How does TreeCaching interact with SDN?}

\subsection{Virtual Clusters}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Physical datacenter architecture and physical clusters
  \item Sharing datacenter resources and isolation requirements
\end{enumerate}
