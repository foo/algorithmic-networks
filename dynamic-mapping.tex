\section{Introduction, practical motivations and related work}

Abstract/introduction/practical motivation/related work compilation.

References and comparisons to previous chapter:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Make a clear connection to embedding from the previous chapter.
  \item Dynamic = discovering the structure of the object to embed in online fashion.
  \item Similar objective function: bandwidth reservation upfront and charging for the communication
  \item Virtual cluster = the worst case bandwidth reservation (complete graph) with KNOWN size; Virtual Cluster $\rightarrow$ data locality and replica selection part of the problem
  \item The extension of the model: migrations that take bandwith reservation (or communication cost) of certain size $\alpha$
\end{enumerate}

Problems that arise (in paper: part of the model): rent or buy / where to migrate and what / which nodes to evict

\section{Model}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Purely mathematical description of the model
  \item The choice of particulare augmentation model
\end{enumerate}
